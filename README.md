# Equity Research Agent (EquiAnalytica)

A multi-agent Python system for comprehensive stock analysis and equity research reporting.


## Overview


**equity-research-agent** leverages multiple specialized sub-agents to perform:
- Fundamental analysis (financial statements, ratios, trends)e
- Technical analysis (price data, indicators, etc.)
- Fund flow analysis (capital inflow/outflow, liquidity),
- Policy analysis (government/regulatory news).

The main agent coordinates these sub-agents and synthesizes their findings into a unified research report.

## Features
- Modular agent-based architecture
- 
- Integrates API, Google Search, and MCP tools for data gathering
- Generates detailed, structured equity research reports,
- Flexible report output formats (PDF/HTML) with full Chinese language support.
- Send reports via email to a specified recipient or distribution group.

## Requirements
- Developed and tested on **Linux**. Performance on Windows is not garanteed
- Python 3.11+
- Dependencies as listed in pyproject.toml, including:
  - [google-adk](https://pypi.org/project/google-adk/)
  - [mcp-query-table](https://pypi.org/project/mcp-query-table/)
  - [mcp](https://pypi.org/project/mcp/)


## Setup on Linux

### 1. Environment Rebuilding

To recreate the project's virtual environment using **uv**, follow these steps:

i. **Install uv (if not already installed)**  
```bash
pip install uv
```

ii. **Clone the repository and navigate into it**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CarlosFinEngg/equity-research-agent.git
cd equity-research-agent
```

iii. **Sync the environment to match `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`**

```bash
uv sync
```

iv. **Activate the virtual environment**
 
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. MCP Configuration

For the setup of MCP servers, please refer to the following,
  - [sequential-thinking](https://smithery.ai/server/@smithery-ai/server-sequential-thinking)

If you use local MCP servers:

 - clone the MCP repo to this project's root folder (parallel with `stock_analysis_agent`)
 - rebuild the venv within the MCP's folder

If you use hosted MCP servers:
  - add you API key to .env
  
Lastly, configure the parameters of `StdioServerParameters()` in agents according to the specific requirement of MCPs.


## Usage

1. Add a `.env` file in `stock_analysis_agent/` and configure environment variables (e.g. LLM and MCP host platform API key) in  as needed, for example:

```bash
GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=FALSE
GOOGLE_API_KEY=...
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
SMITHERY_API_KEY=...
```

2. Configure LLM models in `stock_analysis_agent/config.py`

3. Activate venv
  ```bash
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

4. Then run the agent in ADK WEB:
  ```bash
  adk web
  ```
or run in Terminal:
  ```bash
  adk run stock_analysis_agent
  ```

The analysis report will be generated in both Markdown format and your chosen output format (PDF/HTML). The reports can be found in the `reports` directory with the following naming convention:
```
reports/
    equity_research_report_<company_name>_<ticker>_<YYYYMMDD>.md
    equity_research_report_<company_name>_<ticker>_<YYYYMMDD>.html  # or .pdf
```
